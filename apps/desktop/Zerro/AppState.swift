//  AppState.swift
//  Zerro
//
//  Created by Colin Breeding on 5/27/26.
//
//  Overview
//  --------
//  This file owns the global state for the menu-bar app and the state
//  machine that drives the UI between idle, recording, processing, and
//  done.
//
//  Sections:
//    1. RecordingState  — the discrete UI states the app can be in.
//    2. AppState        — @Observable @MainActor class that holds live
//                          state, owns the per-session RecordingSession,
//                          and exposes the transitions (start/stop/
//                          cancel/reset).
//
//  Phase 7 changed how elapsed time flows. Pre-Phase-7 a 0.1s Timer
//  fired tick() which incremented elapsedSeconds by 0.1 * DEMO_TIME_SCALE.
//  Now elapsedSeconds is driven by the real video PTS published from
//  RecordingSession.onElapsed (~5Hz). The 150s wrappingUp + 180s
//  autoStop thresholds moved out of tick() (deleted) and into
//  handleElapsedUpdate(_:). For dev-time threshold testing without a
//  real 3-minute recording, pass clockMultiplier to RecordingSession —
//  it scales the published elapsed without affecting the file duration.
